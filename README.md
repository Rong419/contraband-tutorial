# Contraband tutorial

This tutorial shows how to use the **contraband** package in **BEAST2** to model continuous trait evolution along a phylogeny with Brownian motion.
Unlike methods that assume a "known", fixed tree, **contraband** lets you estimate the tempo and mode of trait evolution simultaneously with both species relationships and divergence times.
